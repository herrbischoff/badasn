# badasn

A list of ASNs with questionable practices and non-working or unresponsive 
abuse departments despite being major sources of abusive traffic. The ASNs 
listed exhibited persistent abusive behavior over an extended period of time 
until banned.

While being a fervent proponent of a free and unrestricted internet, I equally 
strongly believe that to keep it that way (or prevent it from getting even 
worse) providers need to actively respond to reports of bad actors. If they 
don't, they should be called out.

Use with care and only if you are completely sure about the resulting 
consequences. This list is manually curated, not automatically generated. False 
positives should be minimal.
